Each sub-folder corresponds to an individual 42 Project. In these folders is included :
 - One or several .odt file containing documentation on the specified project.
 - A .rar archive containing the project's subject and the documentation in .pdf format.
 
 For each project, a README file will indicate the repository of the project itself.
